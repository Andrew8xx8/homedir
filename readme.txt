This repo contains a collection of snippets to use with the NERD snippets
plugin (http://github.com/scrooloose/nerdsnippets).

It contains:
* my personal snippets
* all the rails related snippets converted from textmate by Fabio Akita (http://github.com/akitaonrails)
* a bunch of python and php snippets by Gavin Gilmour (http://github.com/gaving)
